# Map-Reduce
A library tool to simulate the mapper/combiner/reducer job. Created for my intro to OS class. 

Uses Multi-Threading to run the MapReduce algorithm.

Compile with a program that utilizes the library with the command ```gcc <NAME OF OTHER PROGRAM> mapreduce.h``` or change the makefile from wordcount.c to whatever program utilizes the library.
